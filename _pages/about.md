I am M Ihsan Al Hafiz, a doctoral researcher at KTH Royal Institute of Technology working on hardware accelerators for neuromorphic computing across the IoT–Edge–Cloud continuum. With eight years of experience in embedded systems engineering, my work explores FPGA development, microcontroller programming, and analog electronics to enable energy-efficient artificial intelligence.

My interests include spiking neural networks, reconfigurable computing, and embedded software design. I'm passionate about solving complex problems and delivering high-quality engineering solutions.
